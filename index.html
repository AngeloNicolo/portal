       <h2 class="subheader">About Me</h2>
       
       <p>Hello my name is Angelo Nicolo I am an emerging proffesional at YearUp in the Application Development course. I found out about YearUp from my sister and my brother in-law. Both of them actually were apart of the classes before me.</p>
       
       <p>I am 21 years old and I am a first generation imigrant from my parents who are from the Philippines. I dont really put to much weight into that statement, I beleive before I am Filipino or American, that I am myself before any sort of label, that my personality is what my idetity is before all the things I had no control over</p>
       
       <p>I am a child of four being the second youngest, I have 2 older sisters and one younger brother that I love very much. I am pretty close to my sibles, of course groing up with them was difficult especailly adolescence. But none the less those hard times made us closer, I appreciate them in my life even if they get on my nerves.   </p>
       
       <p>I am very introverted and shy person, but I am very easy to get along with. In my free time I like to play tennis and watching any form of animated media, such as movies and tv shows. Even though I'm shy I try not to let that stop me from doing the things I want to do. For example in Highschool I was apart of my schools competitve Dance team. I actually have a State Championship trophy with my team for 2019 3A Hip-hop. I wanted to learn more about computers and coding because I never had that opportunity growing up, despite my facination with the subject. </p>
           
      <p>I try to be friendly and humble with anyone I meet for the first time, I think its very important, so I always try to have a good first impression because I dont like it when people have misconception. I hope you enjoyed reading about me, thank you.</p>
